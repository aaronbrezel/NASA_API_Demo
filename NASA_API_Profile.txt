NASA API Profile



NASA's APIs give developers access to a wide variety of agency data. The information
accessable through these APIs range from an archive of exoplanet data to outer space weather
forecasts. For the purpose of this demo, I have focused on the "Mars Rover Images" API, 
which makes image data from NASA's Curiosity, Opportunity, and Spirit rovers avaliable. 

NASA encourages contributions to its growing list of APIs.
The Mars Rover Photo API was built by Chris Cerami, an independant developer. Cerami 
continues to maintain the API, as well. Further inquiries should be directed to 
chrisccerami@gmail.com via email or on Twitter at @chrisccerami.   


How to setup and use NASA's Mars Rover Photos API 

Step 1: Get your unique API key
	Most API's require developers to apply for a unique key. This key is a password of
	sorts for the API and allows the host, to track data usage. To get a NASA API key,
 	Navigate to https://api.nasa.gov/index.html. Scroll down to the "Get Your API Key"
	header and fill out the form. You should immediately recieve a unique key consisting
	of a string of letters and numbrs. Save this string.
Step 2: Navigate to https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos
	You can navigate to the Mars Rover Photos API from the NASA API homepage, but I
	recommend using the link above as navigation on the site is a little wonky. Review
	the types of rover cameras, what a Martian sol is, etc. There is going to be a lot
	abbreviations in your data, so it helps to be knowlegeable. Try out some of the 
	example queries 
	(https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/curiosity/photos?sol=1000&api_key=DEMO_KEY)
	You can swap out "DEMO_KEY" for your own API key and the url will return the same
	information. Remove "DEMO_KEY" without replacing with your own key and you can see 
	how an API key acts as a kind of password. Note the variables at play such as 
	"sol=1000". Change "1000" to "900" and the url still provides information. That is 
	the basis of how these API requests work. Change variables and the format of the url 
	and you will recieve different bits of information.
Step 3: Did something break?
	Current documentation states that, in addition to photo information, you should also
	be able to access manifests and latest photos for each rover. As of Feb. 2, 2019, I 
	don't think these two features are functional. This issue may be fixed at some point.
  

Variables

When building a url for this API, there are three categories of variables:
	

	1. Rover: Curiosity, Opportunity, Spirit
		a. When searching for photos, you must limit your search by rover
		b. ex: .../rovers/curiosity/photos?... or .../rovers/opportunity/photos?...
	2. Filter: Earth day, Martian sol, Camera type
		a. After selecting a rover, you can filter the photo results based on these
		three variables. You must include at least one of these filters. Earth day
		represents the day on earth the photo was taken. Earth day and Martian sol can be used in tandem with Camera type, but Earth
		day and Martian sol cannot be used together. Earth day should be added with
		a YYYY-MM-DD format and Martian sol represents a number 0 to the total number
		of days a rover has been on Mars. Review camera types on the official Mars
		rover API page.
		b. ex: .../photos?sol=1000&api_key=API_key
		ex: .../photos?earth_date=2016-5-25&camera=fhaz&api_key=API_key   
		
		
	3. Page: 1, 2, 3, etc.
		a. If the API request returns too many results, you can limit them by 
		setting a page number. Pages limit the results to 25 photos. Be advised,
		if you set a page number and return an empty set, it could be because there
		were only 25 photo entries on that day in the first place. 
		b. ex: .../photos?sol=1000&page=2&api_key=API_key
	  

Example API requests:

Query 1
url: https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/Opportunity/photos?earth_date=2015-6-3&camera=pancam&page=2&api_key=API_key

Rover: Opportunity
	a. Selects the Opportunity rover
Filters: earth_date=2015-6-3, camera=pancam
	a. Selects only photos taken with the panoramic camera on June 3, 2015 
Page: 2
	a. Only returns the 26th through 50th photo that day  
  
Returns: 

{"photos":[{"id":106898,"sol":4037,"camera":{"id":17,"name":"PANCAM","rover_id":6,"full_name":"Panoramic Camera"},"img_src":"http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/gallery/all/1/p/4037/1P486570059EFFCNJDP2407R2M1-BR.JPG","earth_date":"2015-06-03","rover":{"id":6,"name":"Opportunity","landing_date":"2004-01-25","launch_date":"2003-07-07","status":"active","max_sol":5111,"max_date":"2018-06-11","total_photos":198439,"cameras":[{"name":"FHAZ","full_name":"Front Hazard Avoidance Camera"},{"name":"NAVCAM","full_name":"Navigation Camera"},{"name":"PANCAM","full_name":"Panoramic Camera"},{"name":"MINITES","full_name":"Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES)"},{"name":"ENTRY","full_name":"Entry, Descent, and Landing Camera"},{"name":"RHAZ","full_name":"Rear Hazard Avoidance Camera"}]}}]}

Each photo has a unique id. As it happens, Opportunity only took 26 photos on it's panoramic
camera on June 3, 2015. Therefore, only one photo is returned on the proverbial second page.
Each photo contains a small package of photo-specific data and data about the rover. That
includes how many days the rover had been on Mars before the photo was taken (4037). You also
recieve a url of where you can find the photo online. Feel free to view the photo, but it is
not that exciting. Finally, each package of photo data also includes information about the
rover that took it. For example, the "launch_date" of the rover was July 7, 2003. The 
"max_date," or last time photos were pinged back to Earth, is June 11, 2018. A day later, a
dust storm forced Opportunity into hibernation. NASA has not been able to reestablish 
contact, since.

Query 2
url: https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/spirit/photos?sol=1&api_key=API_key

Rover: Spirit
	a. Selects the Spirit rover
Filters: sol=1
	a. Selects only photos taken by the Spirit rover on its first Martian day
Page: N/A
	a. No page filter returns all the photos taken on Martian day 1

Returns:

Above is a small snippet of the json object returned by this API request. The data format is
the same as the previous query. This is an interesting query to run if you want to see the
first photos the Spirit rover took on Mars.

Query 3

url: https://api.nasa.gov/mars-photos/api/v1/rovers/spirit/photos?sol=1&page=5&api_key=API_key

Rover: Spirit
	a. Selects the spirit rover
Filters: sol=1
	a. Selects only photos taken by the Spirit rover on its first Martian day
Page: 5
	a. Selects only the 101-125th photos taken that sol

Returns: 

{"photos":[]}

Don't be shocked. What this result tells you is that the Spirit rover did not take more than
100 photos on its first Martian day. With no photos, the API returns an Empty set. 

Limitations

NASA's APIs and the data they provide are completely free for both private and comercial use.

However, http requests from a API key are capped at 1,000  per hour. Once that number is
exceeded requets using that API key are temporarily blocked. This cap extends across APIs. A
single API key cannot make 500 requests from the Techport API and 600 requests from the
GeneLab Search API in the same hour. 
  
The http request counter resets on a rolling basis. For example if you make 100 requests at 
10:15 a.m. and 900 requests at 10:30, your API key will be prevented from making any more 
requests until 11:15, when you can now make 100 more requests. If you require more requests 
than that per hour, you can contact Jason Duley at jason.duley@nasa.gov to request a 
higher rate limit for your API key. 



Process Log

1. My starting point was https://api.nasa.gov/index.html
2. I worked my way down this page, reading up on the API and signing up for a API Key. I stored that API Key in a seperate file from NASA_API_Demo.py
3. Near the bottom of the page, underneath the "Authentication," are the next set of directions for using your API Key. In short, they tell you to click on a hyperlink and go to this page: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#authentication Not the smoothest UI experience, but it's no problem. 
4. Once on this page, I read up on the API key request limit. I then tested out queries for the different API's. Luckly there is not much documentation other than showing the url requests. There is plenty of room for expanding on how to effectively use these requests in python.  
5. I settled on the Mars Rover API. Under that API's heading, I found a link to Chris Cerami's github page https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api, which has more info on how to use his api. I primarily used the API documentation on Cerami's github page to guide my exploration. I also lifted (with citation) his table listing the different cameras on each rover for my own API documentation. 
6. I played around with several different API calls.  
7. I came to an issue where some of the queries in the initial documentation do not work anymore. I left a issue post on Cerami's github repository. https://github.com/chrisccerami/mars-photo-api/issues/82
8. I started writing up the documentation. As a matter of small interest, while writing up query 1, I noticed that Opportunity last ping date was June 11, 2018. That is the a day before dust storm forced the rover into hibernation. NASA has not been able to reestablish contact, since.
